wfo-0001026229	conservation	Endangered B1 a,b (i, ii, iii, iv). Solanum anisocladum is known from only three localities and its calculated extent of occurrence using the MCP is 834 km2. Despite the fact that the Bahia registry is far from the one in Pernambuco state, the MCP reflects the narrow range of coastal rainforest where the species is expected to occur. Although the type locality is now part of a private reserve owned by a sugar company (RPPN Frei Caneca), it consists of a small group of forest fragments in a severely damaged landscape mainly modified by extensive agriculture based on monoculture (plantations). Generally, the Atlantic coastal rainforest has been severely damaged in northeastern Brazil in the past decades due to urban expansion and extensive farming.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-anisocladum		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	234b7f29-edcf-4c2c-a621-877295b01f18#conservation

wfo-0001026241	conservation	Solanum anomalostemon is known from only a few collections, all collected within 20 km of each other in the Río Apurímac drainage. The species had not been collected for more than half a century until its recent rediscovery in Cusco Department, on the other side of the Apurímac. The dry forests in which it occurs are not widely protected in Peru, and S. anomalostemon does not occur in or near any of the Peruvian network of protected areas (INRENA). Solanum anomalostemon can be added to the list of endemic Peruvian solanums, and using the IUCN Red List criteria (IUCN, 2001) it has been given a preliminary conservation status of Endangered (EN B1a[iii], B2a) based on its restricted distribution (extent of occurrence , 5000 km2, area of occupancy , 100 km2), low number of populations (2-3), and threatened and unprotected habitat.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-anomalostemon		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	82f41848-35e9-4274-96cf-bb9352014014#conservation

wfo-0001026490	conservation	According to the IUCN Red List Categories (IUCN 2011), Solanum baretiae is classified as Data Deficient (DD). Although Solanum baretiae occurs over a broad geographic range (> 60, 000 km2), it has been collected at fewer than 10 localities (localities within a few kilometers of each other have been grouped for this assessment) and from a narrow elevational band within its range. The relatively small number of collections of this species suggests that it is rare in the habitats where it occurs. Furthermore, these localities are near expanding population centers and habitats in these areas are highly fragmented and degraded. Nevertheless, Solanum baretiae seems to be well suited to habitat change caused by human activities, since EJT and LB observed thriving populations along roadsides and among shrubs between the town of Guzmango (Dept. Cajamarca, Peru) and the cultivated and pasture lands that surround the town. Further data regarding the distribution and abundance of Solanum baretiae are needed before we can make a more solid assessment of its conservation status.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-baretiae		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	7fb3cbd3-907a-4887-a4df-927867a6c723#conservation

wfo-0001026651	conservation	(IUCN, 2013). Endangered (EN) B1; B2 ab (ii, iii, iv). The EOO and AOO calculated were 4, 076.04 km2 and 48 km2respectively resulting in the assessment of the Endangered category. The species is known from eight localities only, most of which are subject to urban expansion and deforestation due to tourism and agriculture. Although the species is known to occur in three protected areas [Área de Preservação Ambiental Serra da Mantiqueira (APA Mantiqueira), Parque Estadual de Campos do Jordão and Parque Nacional de Itatiaia] we suggest to maintain it as Endangered due to: the effectiveness of APAs in protecting the species is doubtful, the Parque Estadual de Campos do Jordão have considerable areas with exotic species, and both it and Parque Nacional do Itatiaia have considerable areas with habitats not suitable to Solanum bradei (such as outcrops and highland grassfields). Although Solanum bradei is known to grow on secondary fragments and in a wide elevation range, threats to it are clear, considering that the southern Mantiqueira range, where most collections are from, is situated between the two main urban centers in Brazil and has become a tourism hub. In addition, over the past few decades the montane forests and the highland fields of Mantiqueira have been increasingly converted to pastures, monocultures or urban centers.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-bradei		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	8c56a091-4eda-4f87-b102-cb20a3751deb#conservation
wfo-0001026651	distribution	Solanum bradei is restricted to the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. The known specimens are mainly from the Mantiqueira mountain range in the border area between those states, with one disjunct collection from Serra do Mar, in the Bocaina region of northeastern São Paulo State. Occasional in the understory or shaded forest edges of well-preserved or secondary fragments of the Brazilian Atlantic coastal rainforest (Floresta Ombrófila Densa of Veloso et al. 1991), normally close to water courses, in elevations ranging from 1, 000 to 2, 000 m. In cultivation in Belo Horizonte, Solanum bradei flowered year round. Preliminary crossing studies suggested it was self-incompatible as no fruits were produced in selfed plants, but more individuals should be used for a definitive conclusion.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-bradei		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	8c56a091-4eda-4f87-b102-cb20a3751deb#distribution

Solanum caelicolum is known from four localities very close to each other in the state of Espírito Santo, and its calculated extent of occurrence using the MCP is 31 km2. At the municipality of Santa Teresa, the locality of three of the collections, there still are several well preserved forest remnants, some of them within protected reserves. One of the collections was found at a city reserve (Estação Biológica de São Lourenço) and therefore we are not treating this species as critically endangered. The populations from further north in the Colatina region are more susceptible to changes in the species area of occupancy due to urban expansion and farming.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-caelicolum		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	48080cea-7108-433b-ab36-73cf163f9802#conservation

wfo-0001027050	distribution	Solanum chrysotrichum is indigenous to humid montane forests from southern Mexico to Panama. In much of Central America it is found in secondary growth, disturbed areas and clearings in oak forest and montane wet forest at (900-)1300-2800 m in elevation. It is also naturalised in many subtropical parts of the world such as Indochina, Sri Lanka, Africa, and Australia. In Australia, it occurs in south-eastern Queensland and extreme north-eastern New South Wales where it inhabits degraded places in association with a range of other weedy species. According to Welman (2003), it has been collected in West Africa (Nigeria), Zimbabwe, Malawi, and in South Africa. The oldest specimen seen from South Africa dates to 1909.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-chrysotrichum		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	e07481aa-228d-40ec-b495-3e3394de69d1#distribution

wfo-0001027581	conservation	Solanum dillonii is relatively widely distributed in the Amotape-Huancabamba region, and has an EOO of 22, 492 km2, giving a status of possible Near Threatened, and an AOO (with cell size of 0.04 km 2) of 10, 541 km2, giving a status of Least Concern (IUCN 2001). Using a cell size of 2 km2 gives an AOO of 28 km2, resulting in an assessment of Endangered. Given that the species is of a partially secondary nature, growing in disturbed areas and along roads, the status of possibly Near Threatened is the most realistic assessment for Solanum dillonii, but more collecting with population assessment will help refine this.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-dillonii		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	50f28165-43c7-4de9-97a7-c1a55e4f4002#conservation

wfo-0001027834	distribution	Solanum erianthum is a common weedy species throughout most of Mexico, Central America and the West Indies except for the arid interior of northern Mexico, and is the only member of sect. Brevantherum reaching the United States. It is common in southern Florida and found in Cameron County, Texas near the Gulf of Mexico. Frequent in thickets of secondary-growth vegetation, along roadsides and fields and in other disturbed habitats, as well as in forest openings and along riverbanks.Solanum erianthum is native to North and Central America and is apparently rare in northern South America. It is adventive in India, China, the East Indies, and Australia. It was possibly introduced to the Philippines and thence to China, and elsewhere during the Spanish Galleon trade from Mexico, which commenced in the 16th century.Solanum erianthum occurs in many vegetation zones, from humid lowland evergreen tropics near sea level to dry Acacia-cactus thorn-scrub and, at higher altitudes (to 2000 m) in Pinus-Quercus forests. It is most common, however, below 1000 m. Individual scattered plants are most commonly seen but large thickets also occur where conditions are favorable.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-erianthum		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	bdefc404-50aa-483e-90f7-b3bdff0ff2ef#distribution

wfo-0001027881	conservation	Endangered (EN) B1 a, b (i, ii, iii, iv). Solanum evolvuloides is known from only two localities, where the landscape has been strongly modified in the last decades due to the expansion of urban centers and extensive farming. The region has been focus of several surveys undertaken by the CEPEC group, in association with the New York Botanical Garden; despite this, only a few collections of this species have been made. Although one collection was made in a very disturbed area (Jardim 1843), the most recent collection is from a well-preserved forest fragment, and the species was not found in surrounding areas. There are no collections from within conservation units.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-evolvuloides		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	723245ad-62d2-4fd8-a4ff-c0aab08ee0ae#conservation
wfo-0001027881	distribution	Solanum evolvuloides is known only from the southeastern part of Bahia state (Fig. 3 in Giacomin & Stehmann 2012), Brazil, occurring in the transition zone between deciduous forests and xeric formations of shrubby Caatinga (as defined by Velloso et al. 2002). Ecology. Solanum evolvuloideswas recently recollected by Giacomin in the municipality of Jequié in a typical shrubby Caatinga formation, that is associated in this region with large granitic outcrops. The occurrence on the banks of the Rio de Contas near the city of Itacaré [Jardim, J.G. 1843 (CEPEC)] might be an occasional case of water dispersal by the river, which arises in a xeric environment near the center of the state in the Caatinga biome. Despite having been found in environments with marked seasonality, the species is apparently not annual, as evidenced by the woody stem bases.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-evolvuloides		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	723245ad-62d2-4fd8-a4ff-c0aab08ee0ae#distribution

wfo-0001028033	conservation	(IUCN, 2013). Critically Endangered (CR) B1; B2 ab (iii, iv). Solanum friburgense is known from two localities closely situated to each other within the same municipality, that represents an AOO of 8 km2. The type specimen was collected in 1990 and despite an intensive inventory that was recently carried out in the area (Lima and Guedes-Bruni 1997), no additional collections were made until 2009. Although the EOO could not be calculated because only two points are available, if the species is actually endemic to Nova Friburgo and surroundings it would probably fit the Critically Endangered category (less than 100 km2 ). Even considering the occurrence within two conservation units and the paucity of material available for analysis, we provisionally suggest it to be assessed as Critically Endangered, regarding it seems to have a reproductive system based on vegetative propagation (see Discussion below). Within RPPN Bacchus two large populations are known (about 50 individuals), but no flowering specimens were observed in the field over three consecutive years (2009, 2010 and 2011).		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-friburgense		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	03c601aa-5fdd-4be1-ba2d-2bed6f187d4b#conservation
wfo-0001028033	distribution	Narrowly endemic in southern Brazil, known from only two localities in the municipality of Nova Friburgo in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Both localities are within conservation units, one public (Reserva Ecológica de Macaé de Cima) and one private (RPPN Bacchus). Rare in the understory of well-preserved fragments of the Brazilian Atlantic coastal rainforest, at elevations of about 1, 500 m. The species always shows a well-developed rhizome system. This suggests the plant invests heavily in vegetative propagation, which is consistent with the few flowering specimens found in the field. In cultivation, so few flowers were produced that no crossing studies were performed.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-friburgense		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	03c601aa-5fdd-4be1-ba2d-2bed6f187d4b#distribution

Many areas of Amazonia are undercollected, leading to difficulty understanding species distribution (Milliken et al. 2011). Given this, it is highly likely that S. hoffmanseggii is more widespread and abundant then our data indicate.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-hoffmanseggii		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	6ee13ef5-c30a-46a6-873c-9b20710d9201#conservation

wfo-0001028883	conservation	(IUCN, 2013). Endangered (EN) B2 ab (iii, iv). The species is known from two localities that are about 30 km away from each other with six points available. The calculated EOO was of 34.3 km2 what would led to the Critically Endangered category while the AOO of 20 km2 led to Endangered. We have chosen here to assign it to Endangered, a less severe category for three reasons: the species occurs in more than one location, it is known from within a effectively protected area (Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca), and the other location where it is found is somewhat remote. Nevertheless, Solanum kriegeri is from a very specific habitat in well-preserved forest fragments and monitoring its populations is strongly recommended. In light of the deforestation pressure surrounding the areas where it is found, we surmise that it might be restricted to its few known localities.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-kriegeri		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	45c6fa59-e662-4931-98a8-57dcbbc77053#conservation

wfo-0001029408	distribution	Solanum mauritianum is a native of Uruguay and southeastern Brazil, but now it is introduced into tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. It was possibly first introduced to Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius, and India by way of the Portuguese trade route, Manila-São Paulo-Capetown-Goa, beginning in the early 16th century. A species of disturbed forest openings, roadsides, or field borders, S. mauritianum is found from sea level to 2000 m. It may occur sporadically or in large thickets and has become a troublesome weed in some areas of Australia and South Africa. Its range is spreading, and it is targeted for chemical and biological control in some areas where it has become a noxious pest.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-mauritianum		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	00aa825f-d29b-4e37-baff-b9110a14f19a#distribution

wfo-0001029646	distribution	Widespread throughout central Mexico (southern Jalisco to Querétato and Veracruz), south to southeastern and south-central Guatemala, to southern Honduras; 1870-3050 m; growing almost exclusively as an epiphyte on horizontal branches of mature Arbutus, cyprus, elm, juniper, pine, or oak trees, often in moss and organic litter. Occasionally the species is found on the ground in the woods, in rotting wood of fallen trees, or in moss, like its sister taxon S. clarum. Spooner et al. (1998) were unable to locate S. morelliforme at some previously documented localities that had been logged and reforested, and the range of this species may have been reduced by deforestation. The southernmost record of S. morelliforme, Molina & Molina 26100, was collected in Honduras in 1961, the only record for that country. Antonio Molina (EAP) kindly led Spooner and collaborators back to the exact spots where he originally collected it in small valleys off the main road from Tegucigalpa to Lapaterique. One of these was at a place called Las Tablas at 1600 m, at 14º03.95’N, 87º22.73’W, and the other at Quebrada Honda, at 1610 m, at 14º03’56”N, 87º24’44”W. The species was no longer present in this area and Spooner et al. (2004) could not find it in other nearby sites.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-morelliforme		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	58bd2fbe-ff60-4d22-bbc3-2d04037d4f0c#distribution

wfo-0001031864	conservation	According to the IUCN Red List Categories (IUCN 2010), S. trifolium is classified as D2 (Vulnerable). The nine known collections of this species are from two to three closely clustered localities within a narrow elevational band (2,500-3,000 m) between San José de Chimbo and Chillanes, Bolívar Province, Ecuador. Solanum trifolium appears to be well suited to the disturbed habitats in the area, and has been collected in disturbed forest fragments, along roadsides, and in cow pastures. Nevertheless, it seems prudent to list it as vulnerable, because of the extremely narrow distribution of this species.		http://solanaceaesource.org/content/solanum-trifolium-0		eng	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/	c1738207-7eb3-4739-b4f5-329c062a942f#conservation
